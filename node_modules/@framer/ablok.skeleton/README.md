# Skeleton

## Overview

Skeleton loading screens are a great way to reduce the perceived loading time of your product. Easily mock-up your loading screens with these components.

### Bone component

As the name already suggests, these are the bones of your skeleton. Simple shapes with a loading animation that combined together outline the shape of your real content.

### Swap component

This component swaps one screen out for another at set interval. Mock-up a slow API call by setting a interval and connecting your skeleton screen and your screen with real content.

Use the â€˜On Canvasâ€™ property to choose if the swap should happen on the canvas or only in preview mode.

_Note: you have to reload the preview mode every time you open it_
